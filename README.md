# lightweight-charts-nicegui
Custom [Lightweight Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/lightweight-charts/) Component for NiceGUI

This is only an example to test the concept and get feedback from the community, and by no means a complete integration of the lightweight-charts library. It shows basic functionality, featuring multiple series and panes for candlesticks, volume and rsi data as well as setting options and running data updates.

1. Install the lightweight-charts JS library by running npm install
2. Run python Test_Nice_LwChart.py
